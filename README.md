# Vending_Machine
Design a synchronous logic control unit for Vending machine and verify using test bench. The machine can take only two types of coins of denomination 1 and 2 in any order. It delivers only one product that is priced Rs. 3. On receiving Rs. 3 the product is delivered by asserting an output X=1 which otherwise remains 0. If it gets Rs. 4 then the product is delivered by asserting X and also a coin return mechanism is activated by output Y = 1 to return a Re. 1 coin . There are two sensors to sense the denomination of the coins that give binary output as shown in the following table. The clock speed is much higher than human response time, i.e. no two coins can be deposited in same clock cycle.
